echo "   - Frontend bug sending wrong offer_id\n";
echo "   - Race condition during concurrent invoice creation\n";
echo "   - Data migration or import issue\n";
echo "3. üõ°Ô∏è To prevent future issues:\n";
echo "   - Add database constraint: ALTER TABLE invoices ADD CONSTRAINT check_offer_match CHECK (offer_id = (SELECT offer_id FROM memberships WHERE id = membership_id))\n";
echo "   - Add validation in InvoiceController to double-check offer_id matches membership\n";
echo "   - Add logging when offer_id is manually set vs auto-set from membership\n";
